# practiceProblems

This is a repo to track my progress on interview preparation, primarily, my work progress through the book [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Fourth-Programming/dp/145157827X/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1541612667&sr=8-7&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview).

Most of the exercises are c++/java style questions but applicable to javascript, and that's what I've implemented the solutions in.  The solutions have unit tests and work in javascript and node except where there are incompatibilities.  (I use ES6 functionality here and there, those answers are named accordingly and obviously won't work in node.)  For what it's worth, I mention whether or not I check the solutions section of the book to make sure I'm on the right track inside the comments of for a particular problem if I had to.  Those cases are rare.

The specific work for those problems is in [book-problems](book-problems).
