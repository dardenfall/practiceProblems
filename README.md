# practiceProblems

This is a repo to track my progress on interview preparation, primarily, my work progress through the book [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Fourth-Programming/dp/145157827X/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1541612667&sr=8-7&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview).

Most of the exercises are c++/java style questions but applicable to javascript, and that's what I've implemented the solutions in.  I use ES6 functionality here and there.  The solutions have unit tests and work in javascript and node except where there are incompatibilities (i.e. es6 spread won't work for node and I don't have a transpile layer)  For what it's worth, I mention whether or not I check the solutions section of the book to make sure I'm on the right track inside the comments of for a particular problem if I had to.  Those cases are rare.

The specific work for those problems is in [book-problems](book-problems).
